# Machine learning model
- **Preparing data**:
Prepare a dataset comprising images paired with clear descriptions or labels. Preprocess the images for algorithm input by resizing, normalization, and applying data augmentation for enhanced diversity. Extract pertinent features from both images and descriptions: leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract high-level image features, while employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract textual features.
- **Implementation**:
For classification tasks, start with logistic regression or decision trees for simplicity. Transition to KNN for more complexity. For advanced tasks, utilize PyTorch to implement a neural network with CNN layers for image classification. Split data into train, validation, and test sets. Employ cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer for training. Evaluate models individually and ensemble results using techniques like voting or averaging. Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Mainly using scikit-learn and PyTorch libraries for implementation.
