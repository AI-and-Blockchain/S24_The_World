Image Classification with CNN and k-NN
This repository contains Python code for image classification using two different methods: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). The code demonstrates how to implement, train, and evaluate models for classifying images as airplanes or non-airplanes.

CNN Image Classification
cnn_image_classification.py: This Python script implements image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
Code Description:
The script loads a synthetic dataset of images and labels (airplane or non-airplane) for demonstration purposes. You should replace this with your own dataset.
It preprocesses the images by resizing them to a fixed size (32x32) and normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1].
The CNN model architecture is defined using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, flattening, and dense layers for classification.
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
It is trained on the training dataset using the fit function.
The trained model is evaluated on a separate test dataset, and accuracy is calculated as the evaluation metric.
k-NN Image Classification
knn_image_classification.py: This Python script implements image classification using a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier.
Code Description:
Similar to the CNN script, it loads the synthetic dataset and preprocesses the images.
The feature vectors are extracted by flattening the images.
A k-NN classifier is created using scikit-learn, with the number of neighbors (k) set to 5.
The classifier is trained on the training dataset.
Predictions are made on the test dataset, and accuracy is calculated as the evaluation metric.
